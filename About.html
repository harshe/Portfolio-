    <h4> About </h4>
      <p>I'm a Graphic Designer in Boston, MA with an interest in photography. I graduated in 2016 with a Bachelors of Science in Visual Communication from M.O.P. Vaishnav College, Chennai, India and currently pursuing my MFA in Graphic Design at Boston University College of Fine Arts, Class of 2018.
Choosing Visual Communication for my undergraduate degree has helped me spread my wings and explore different dimensions of art. During my first and second year at college I wrote two papers along with various visual and video documentation on the topics of “Violence in Indian cinema and its effect on the youth” and “Social Responsibility In Today’s Youth”. I made a documentary on “The effect of technology on children” for which I won two awards. I was given the opportunity to lead as Vice-president of my Undergraduate department’s Create Club. After a successful year of organizing events and projects for the club I was elected as the President in the subsequent year. This further enhanced my people skills and leadership qualities. I also interned at an art studio named RainbowFish Studio that imparted art education to young adults that exposed me to various genres of art.
My background in Visual Communication helped me narrow down my passion for Graphic Design, with letting me experiment, communicate and be the conqueror of type and color, of design and form, of white space and balance. When I'm not in class, in the kitchen trying out new recipes! </p>
